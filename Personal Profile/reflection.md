#Main Concepts Applied
In developing my personal profile page, I focused on several key web development concepts:

-HTML Structure: I structured the page with semantic HTML elements like <header>, <section>, and <footer>. This improved readability and accessibility while providing a clear layout for each section: "About Me," "Education," "Achievements," and "Links."

-CSS Styling and Layout: I applied CSS for layout, color, and hover effects, making the profile visually appealing. Key concepts included flexbox for responsive layouts, border-radius for rounded elements, and box-shadow for subtle effects that added depth.

-Hover Effects and Transitions: I implemented hover effects on social media links to create an interactive user experience. Using CSS transitions, I made the links respond to user actions smoothly.

-New Skills or Knowledge Acquired
Throughout this project, I gained a deeper understanding of:

Responsive Design: Learning how to adapt content for different screen sizes was essential. I used media queries and flexible units (like em and rem) to make the page responsive on both desktop and mobile devices.
CSS Animation Basics: By adding simple transitions to hover effects, I learned how animations can improve interactivity without being distracting.
b. Reflection

What I Learned
This project strengthened my understanding of HTML and CSS fundamentals, especially the importance of clean, semantic code and organized styling. I also discovered how small visual effects, like hover animations, can make a big difference in the user experience.

Challenges Faced and How I Overcame Them
One challenge was making the page responsive. Initially, my layout looked fine on a desktop but was misaligned on mobile screens. I resolved this by using flexbox and media queries to ensure each section adapted to smaller screen widths. For example:

css
Copy code
@media (max-width: 600px) {
    .bio, .social-links {
        flex-direction: column;
        align-items: center;
    }
}

Another challenge was aligning the profile picture correctly across devices. Using a combination of flexbox and margin adjustments, I centered the image, which resolved the alignment issues.

(Insert screenshots showing the initial misalignment and the corrected version here)

c. Clarity & Coherence

I ensured my code was organized and commented for readability. My HTML structure is straightforward, with clear headings for each section, which aligns well with the project's requirements.

Overall, this project enhanced my design and development skills and gave me practical experience in overcoming layout challenges.
