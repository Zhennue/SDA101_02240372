This project turns a design into a working webpage!
I built this webpage using HTML and CSS (or TailwindCSS). It helped me practice translating designs into code and showed my front-end development skills.
How I built it:
 * Examined the Design: I first looked closely at the design to understand its parts and how it should work.
 * Created the Structure: Using HTML, I built the basic structure of the webpage, including sections, navigation, and content areas.
 * Added Style:  With CSS (or TailwindCSS), I made the webpage look like the design by setting colors, fonts, and layouts. I also ensured it works well on different screen sizes.
What I learned:
This project helped me:
 * Understand HTML better
 * Use CSS (or TailwindCSS) to style webpages
 * Make webpages work on all devices (responsiveness)
What's next:
 * I want to try building more complex designs.
 * I'll learn more advanced CSS techniques.
 * Maybe I'll explore a framework like Bootstrap to make responsive design easier.
This project was a great way to improve my front-end development skills!
